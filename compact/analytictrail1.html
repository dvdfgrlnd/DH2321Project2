            <h2>Research question</h2>
            <p>
                Does the largest countries (based on GDP) sorted by continent have similar attitude 
                to private vs state ownership of business? For example is there an attitude towards private ownership in these countries? 
            </p>
            <h2>Select wave</h2>
            <p>
                In the first step you choose which wave (time period) you are interesting in, in this case 
                the period '2010-2014'.

            <h2>Time line</h2>
            <p>
                Displays multiple waves and helps with discovering trends. It can be viewed 
                as a list (left image), or as charts (right image).

            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <p>
                No similar attitude between the countries seemed to exist based on fluctuating attitude in different time periods. 
                There doesn't seem to be a particulary high preference for private or state ownership of business, instead it seems to fluctuate 
                between different time periods.
                The tool could be improved by giving an overview of the answer distribution. 
                And when using the time line you had to scroll up and down a lot when comparing countries which 
                was difficult.
