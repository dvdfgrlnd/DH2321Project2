            <h2>Research question</h2>
            <p>
                Does the largest countries (based on GDP and sorted by continent) attitude toward 
                private vs state ownership of business correlate with the countries GDP growth?
            </p>
            <h2>Start</h2>
            <p>
                Selected the countries and dragged the time line in order to get an brief overview by the radar chart.

            <h2>Find countries min and max</h2>
            <p>
                Now the countries min and max GDP growth was found by dragging the time line.

            <h2>Prepare for comparison</h2>
            <p>
                Right clicking a circle creates a copy with the current year to identify it.

            <h2>Compare</h2>
            <p>
                Hovering over the circles displays the overview (radar chart), and details (list). That makes it easy to compare values 
                different years. The text ('>private', '>state', '~') was added afterwards for clarity and shows if private or state ownership increased with GDP growth 
                ('~' means no difference).

            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <p>
                There doesn't seem to be a correlation beteween the populations attitude towards private ownership and GDP growth. <br>This is based 
                on the fact that only two of the six countries GDP growth occured when private (or state) attitude was at an maximum.
                <br>The tool made it easier to get an overview of the answers and utilised different dimensions to display data which lead  
                to a more compact tool.<br> It could be improved by an automatic way to find minium and maximum values, and multiple selection for 
                automatic comparison.
